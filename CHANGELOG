Version 1
---------------------------------
* With an actual QR code scanner. A camera is required (make sure you allow the app to use the camera when prompted)
* Database of locations included in the app. The first load will be slow, be patient!
* Settings are stored on your device only
* If a scanned QR code cannot be matched against a location already in the app, you will be prompted to enter the location name. It is a one-time thing and the location name will be saved on your device. You can then later on scan the QR code as any other
* Sound on success (turn your volume up for a more immersive and deceptive experience - you can do the evil laughter here)
* To change your details, go back to the settings by tapping the image on the very first screen
* No back button, just refresh the page (on Android Chrome, just "pull down" the page)
* On Android Chrome, you can tap the '...' in the top right, then tap 'Add to Home Screen'
* You should then access the app through the shortcut created (it will make the browser URL bar disappear)
* If this current mirror ("where the app is currently hosted") gets blocked, I will try to post others.
* If you are able, host mirrors of this app yourself (see post below) and spread the link to your mirror amongst your network of friends
* Make sure the mirror you are using is trustworthy
* Use a VPN or a proxy if possible
